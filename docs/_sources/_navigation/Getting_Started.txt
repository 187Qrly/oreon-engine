Getting Started
===============

System Requirements
-------------------
Your System needs to support OpenGL 4.3.

Prerequisites
-------------
Before start you should be familiar with GitHub.
If you are not I recommend to go through the following explanations: https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary .
Make sure that you fully understand the following keywords:

- Branch
- Clone
- Fork

If you want to become a contributor or even a collaborator you should also understand:

- Commit
- Fetch
- Merge
- Pull (Fetch + Merge in one command)
- Upstream
- Pull Request

Github User Account
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
If you don't have a GitHub User Account, Sign up for one. You will need it to fork the project and stay up-to-date.

Eclipse Mars IDE
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The recommended IDE is Eclipse Mars https://eclipse.org/mars . 

.. note::
	You can also use Oxygen or Neon, but the following instructions for setting up the project are based on Mars.

Setup Oreon Engine Java Project
--------------------------

Fork the repository
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To fork the repository just log-in to your GitHub account and click on the top-right corner of this page or visit https://github.com/oreon3D/Oreon.Engine-OpenGL-Java .
Just click the "Fork" Button and you are done. You will see Oreon.Engine-OpenGL-Java as a forked repository at your user repositories.
Now you are ready to clone the repository to your local system and set it up as a project in Eclipse.

Clone the repository and import the project into Eclipse
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Open Eclipse IDE, choose File -> Import... -> Projects from Git

- Select Clone URI -> Next >

.. image:: /_images/CloneURI.png


- Go to your forked Oreon.Engine-OpenGL-Java repository on GitHub
- copy URL -> paste URL into the URI-field
	- Eclipse will fill the other fields for you
- type in your GitHub username and password
- click Next >

.. image:: /_images/RepoUri_User.png


- Select master-branch -> click Next >

- choose a directory for the local repository -> click Next >

.. image:: /_images/local_Repo.png


- Eclipse will clone the GitHub repository to the previously created local repository
- when finished, choose 'Import using the New Project wizard' -> click Finish

.. image:: /_images/build_local_repo.png


- Choose Java Project -> Next >

.. image:: /_images/New_project.png

- Set a project name
- Deselect 'Use default location'
	- Choose the project path of your local repository as location

.. image:: /_images/newProject2.png	

- click Finish
- Now you see the project in your project explorer with a lot of errors, because there is one last thing to do. Since the project uses Maven-dependencies it has to be converted to a Maven-project.

.. image:: /_images/errors.png

- Right click on the project in project explorer -> go to 'Configure' and click on 'convert to maven project'

Congratulations! You are done!
You will see the project in your Eclipse package Explorer as a Maven-project without missing dependencies. 
Good luck and have fun with the project!
